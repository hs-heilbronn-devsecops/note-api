  # The check is implemented on the Snyk side
  # because for some reason it fails to authenticate
  # when running in the repo of a Github Org.
  # This could be because Orgs should authenticate via Service Account
  # (see https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/authenticate-to-use-the-cli#how-to-authenticate-to-use-the-cli-in-ci-cd-pipelines).
  # However the Snyk docu does not document this behaviour.
  # TL;DL: Snyks PATs are not working in a Github Org Repos.
